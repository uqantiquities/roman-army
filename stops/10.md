This stop concludes your tour. 

In this audio tour, we have explored the reach of the Roman army and discovered what military life was like for the Romans. 

Ancient artefacts allow us to reach beyond the political and military histories we usually find in written texts, and gain some understanding of the perspectives and experiences of the Roman soldier. They also help us to think about the importance and impact of the Roman Army, to Rome, and to the ancient world.
